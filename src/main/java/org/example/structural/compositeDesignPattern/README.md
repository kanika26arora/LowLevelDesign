Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then 
work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

Using the Composite pattern makes sense only when the core model of your app can be represented as a tree.
Like a FileSystem.. a filesystem is of 2 types - a file and a directory
A directory can have files and directories so a directory has list of file systems.
