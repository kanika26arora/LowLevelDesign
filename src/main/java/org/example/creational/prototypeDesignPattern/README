We use prototype method if we want to obtain clone of an object of a class where object creation is
very expensive.

So we create an interface Prototype/Cloneable and all the classes that we want to provide implementation to
create clones of, have to override prototype interface.

Now the question is why cant client class create object by themselves? Why cant client call
MyStudent myStudent = new MyStudent(1, "Kanika", 28)?

It might be that MyStudent class provided by library has private fields or private constructors to restrict the visibility.
So library can expose only clone method and client app can call clone method.
